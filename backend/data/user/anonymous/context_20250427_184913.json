  "content": "\n\n\n\nWriteWise is an AI-powered email assistant that learns how you write by analysing your past messages and then helps you polish new drafts so they still feel like “you.” It builds a personal writing profile—capturing your formality, politeness, certainty and even emotional tone—by extracting linguistic features and grouping them into style clusters. Once it knows your voice, it uses the OpenAI GPT-4 API to suggest stronger subject lines, clearer structure and more precise wording, all while keeping your authentic phrasing intact.\n\nUnder the hood, a Python/Flask backend handles feature extraction, PCA-based clustering and ML-driven profile generation, then serves a lightweight Chrome extension that plugs right into Gmail. When you start typing, your draft is sent to the server, matched to the cluster that best fits the context (formal, casual or professional), and rewritten on the fly. The whole pipeline runs in the cloud—scalable compute for style analysis, secure storage for your profile and metadata, and fast OpenAI calls for instant feedback.\n\nThe result is a smarter email workflow that saves you time and keeps your genuine voice front and centre. Whether you’re firing off a quick catch-up to a friend or drafting a proposal for a client, WriteWise adapts its suggestions to the situation. As you use it more, it refines its understanding of your style, so every message you send could be a little crisper—and still unmistakably you.",
