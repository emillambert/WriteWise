      "body": "Dear Rens,\r\n\r\nThank you for your call earlier. First we would like to summarise the\r\nsituation with Oude Delft and how we would fix it. Most immediately there\r\nis a ground water problem that needs to be fixed as a matter of urgency.\r\nFor this we have a quote to fix it of 3800 euros. There is also damp in the\r\nwall by a radiator in the living room. The cause of this is unknown but\r\ncould be a leak from the radiator. So someone needs to open up the wall and\r\ntry to fix it. This should be done at the same time as previous problem.\r\nOnce these are completed Emil can move in.\r\n\r\nLastly there is a significant water build up in the wall behind the shower\r\nand toilet. This issue is less urgent and we can wait for 6 months living\r\nthere to see how it develops and what the cause is (leaky tiles, leak from\r\nthe roof or directly from the back wall).\r\nIt is quite likely that the resolution will require significant renovations\r\nto the bathroom and toilet. And something will need to be done to protect\r\nthe back wall and this would need to be done jointly with the upstairs\r\nowner.\r\n\r\n<https://www.google.com/maps/search/Verwersdijk+106+%0D%0A+Vrouwjuttenland?entry=gmail&source=g>\r\nWe need a little time to think about our options.

      "body": "Dear Rens,\r\n\r\nThank you for your call earlier. First we would like to summarise the\r\nsituation with Oude Delft and how we would fix it. Most immediately there\r\nis a ground water problem that needs to be fixed as a matter of urgency.\r\nFor this we have a quote to fix it of 3800 euros. There is also damp in the\r\nwall by a radiator in the living room. The cause of this is unknown but\r\ncould be a leak from the radiator. So someone needs to open up the wall and\r\ntry to fix it. This should be done at the same time as previous problem.\r\nOnce these are completed Emil can move in.\r\n\r\nLastly there is a significant water build up in the wall behind the shower\r\nand toilet. This issue is less urgent and we can wait for 6 months living\r\nthere to see how it develops and what the cause is (leaky tiles, leak from\r\nthe roof or directly from the back wall).\r\nIt is quite likely that the resolution will require significant renovations\r\nto the bathroom and toilet. And something will need to be done to protect\r\nthe back wall and this would need to be done jointly with the upstairs\r\nowner.\r\n\r\n<https://www.google.com/maps/search/Verwersdijk+106+%0D%0A+Vrouwjuttenland?entry=gmail&source=g>\r\nWe need a little time to think about our options.

It would have to be Friday\r\nmorning so between 9 am and 1:30 pm (preferably more towards 1:30).\r\n\r\nWe also had a few questions/things-to-confirm we wanted to ask the owner:\r\n\r\n1. What is still going to be done by the owner?\r\n\r\n2. What is the condition of the original flooring in the study where the\r\nfloor is elevated?\r\n\r\n3. What is the energy label of the property, or, if not available, what was\r\nit before the house was separated?\r\n\r\nAs well as this, we want to look at a few more places. I've put a few\r\nplaces we think are promising:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.funda.nl/en/koop/delft/huis-88738656-raamstraat-122/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.funda.nl/en/koop/delft/huis-42397893-singelstraat-34/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.funda.nl/en/koop/delft/huis-42300315-cellebroerstraat-9/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.funda.nl/en/koop/delft/huis-42392572-gasthuislaan-251/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.funda.nl/en/koop/delft/appartement-42302331-ezelsveldlaan-84/\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nEmil\r\n",

Although we will wait with the toilet, we would like to move ahead\r\nquickly in February to deal with the rising ground damp and the exposure of\r\nthe wall by the radiator.

      "body": "Dear Rens,\r\n\r\nThank you for your call earlier. First we would like to summarise the\r\nsituation with Oude Delft and how we would fix it. Most immediately there\r\nis a ground water problem that needs to be fixed as a matter of urgency.\r\nFor this we have a quote to fix it of 3800 euros. There is also damp in the\r\nwall by a radiator in the living room. The cause of this is unknown but\r\ncould be a leak from the radiator. So someone needs to open up the wall and\r\ntry to fix it. This should be done at the same time as previous problem.\r\nOnce these are completed Emil can move in.\r\n\r\nLastly there is a significant water build up in the wall behind the shower\r\nand toilet. This issue is less urgent and we can wait for 6 months living\r\nthere to see how it develops and what the cause is (leaky tiles, leak from\r\nthe roof or directly from the back wall).\r\nIt is quite likely that the resolution will require significant renovations\r\nto the bathroom and toilet. And something will need to be done to protect\r\nthe back wall and this would need to be done jointly with the upstairs\r\nowner.\r\n\r\n<https://www.google.com/maps/search/Verwersdijk+106+%0D%0A+Vrouwjuttenland?entry=gmail&source=g>\r\nWe need a little time to think about our options. As far as other\r\nproperties are concerned there are some other options that look interesting:\r\n\r\nVerwersdijk 106\r\n<https://www.funda.nl/koop/delft/huis-42349523-verwersdijk-106/>\r\nVrouwjuttenland 4\r\n<https://www.funda.nl/koop/delft/appartement-42344943-vrouwjuttenland-4/>\r\nBrabantse Turfmarkt 19 a\r\n<https://www.funda.nl/koop/delft/appartement-42333138-brabantse-turfmarkt-19-a/>\r\n\r\nWe have written to the selling agents to enquire about their status.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nEmil\r\n",
