The\r\nfirst thing that we will need to work on is the motor situation I talked\r\nabout. Before that it would be great to get you up to scratch with the\r\nlegal side of things.\r\n\r\nI've attached the legal bible (i wrote it quickly so its not the best but\r\ndoes give a good overview). On the drive\r\n<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UOmeCYiJXqExS7HbAzumV7UNlq95eZvG?usp=sharing>\r\nthere\r\nis also the contracts, if you could look at the templates it shows the NDAs\r\nand partnership agreements.

We have found a suitable\r\nalternative so now is time to figure out what we want and how to handle it\r\nwith saluqi.\r\n\r\nWe should schedule a morning or afternoon to go through this all, if you\r\ncould fill out your availability\r\n<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C-Pw8J8DpLT7NW4cLwNqhT3jZTodYcPKxyUct7MYjew/edit?usp=sharing>\r\nfor the month, I will give a call so we can schedule in the time. I'm\r\nflexible with the in person time, but it would be nice for you to be there\r\nfor a day or two at the beginning to meet some people here.

I want to work\r\non it over the summer when I have some time.\r\n\r\nThe other reason I want to reach out is to see what potential\r\ncollaboration there is.
